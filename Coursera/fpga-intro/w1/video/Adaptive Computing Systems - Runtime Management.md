- FPGAs enable the development of adaptive computing systems, which are flexible at runtime.
- These systems can be in the form of programmable system-on-chip, programmable system-on-multiple chips, or heterogeneous computing systems.
- In adaptive computing systems, a software application runs on a processor (or multiple processors) and acts as a controller for hardware components.
- The software part can be either a standalone code or a complete operating system, with the latter providing more flexibility through multiprocessing and resource scheduling.
- Standalone code is suitable for small systems, but operating systems are more appropriate for complex systems as they offer a higher level of abstraction and better management of hardware components.
- Adding support for reconfiguration-specific hardware and reconfigurable components is necessary when using a standard operating system.
- The hardware and software parts must be designed to allow the creation of a reconfigurable architecture.
- Design phase and reconfigurable ecosystems play a crucial role in providing an effective user interface and maximizing performance gains from the underlying reconfigurable hardware architecture.
